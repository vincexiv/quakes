# Earthquakes

Just me playing around with RxJs. Shout out to [Sergi Mansilla](https://github.com/sergi); He wrote Reactive Programming with RxJs. This is just one of the many projects I did while reading that book. Other projects I did include [rx](https://github.com/vincexiv/rx), [spaceship game](https://github.com/vincexiv/spaceship), and many others. It was a great read
